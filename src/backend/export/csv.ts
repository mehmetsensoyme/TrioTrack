 * CSV export of expenses, for spreadsheets. This is a one-way convenience
 * format: the JSON envelope remains the ONLY restore format, so this module
 * deliberately does not participate in CURRENT_EXPORT_VERSION / the upgrader
 * contract in format.ts.
 *
 * Spreadsheet-friendliness choices:
 * - RFC 4180 quoting (fields containing comma/quote/newline are quoted,
 *   inner quotes doubled) with CRLF line endings.
 * - A UTF-8 BOM prefix so Excel detects the encoding and renders ₹ and
 *   non-Latin category names instead of mojibake.
 * - Amounts as plain dot-decimal numbers — no symbol, no grouping — so every
 *   spreadsheet parses them as numbers.

/**
 * Neutralises spreadsheet formula injection.
 *
 * Category names, titles and descriptions are free text the user types. A
 * value beginning `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` or a control character is executed as a
 * FORMULA by Excel, Numbers and Google Sheets when the CSV is opened — so an
 * expense titled `=HYPERLINK("http://x","click")` becomes a live link in a
 * file the user may well forward to someone else.
 *
 * Prefixing with an apostrophe is the standard mitigation: spreadsheets treat
 * the rest as literal text and do not display the apostrophe itself. Applied
 * to TEXT columns only — amounts must stay machine-parseable, and a negative
 * amount legitimately starts with `-`.
